Insurance Claim Management System (Flutter Web)

A Flutter web application for managing hospital insurance claims with a complete workflow from claim creation to final settlement. The system supports bills, advances, and settlements, with automatic financial calculations and status changes across Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Partially Settled, and Fully Settled.

Built with a focus on usability and accurate business rules, the app includes a dashboard view, editable claim records, validations, and controlled workflow transitions. Settlement-related statuses are automatically derived from totals and pending amount. Data persists locally in the browser.

This project demonstrates end‑to‑end claim lifecycle handling, financial tracking, and state‑driven UI using Flutter Web.
